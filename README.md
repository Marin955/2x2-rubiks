[UNFINISHED] 2x2 Rubiks Cube Solving Algorithm in Java (Personal Project)

This is just something I work on in my free time. I'm still a beginner in programming. 
Currently only the Cube data structure (adjacency matrix) and the twisting functions are done.
The solving algorithm works, but it's bruteforcing so it's terribly slow, still working on it.
