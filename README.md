[UNFINISHED] 2x2 Rubiks Cube Solving Algorithm in Java (Personal Project)

This is just something I work on in my free time. I'm still a beginner in programming. 
Currently, only the Cube data structure (adjacency matrix) and the twisting functions are done.
Planning on bruteforcing all possible moves until the cube achieves the solved state.
