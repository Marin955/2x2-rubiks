2x2 Rubiks Cube Solving Algorithm in Java (Personal Project)

---------------How to use------------------------

Inside the Main.java file there's a line that says:

  String stateToBeSolved = \"wogybgryowgbowywbrogyrrb\"

Change that input string to whatever your cube looks like by following this rule:

Green is "g"
White is "w"
and so on...

![Sample](sample_input.jpg)

The top side is the side containg (1,2,3,4), the front side is the side containing(9,10,11,12)

So the input string from the image above would be:

"ywborworbyrwogywrbgogbgy"



After that Compile&Run and the solution should pop up in a few seconds!

Output for the cube state from the image above:
