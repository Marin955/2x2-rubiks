2x2 Rubiks Cube Solving Algorithm in Java (Personal Project)

---------------How to use------------------------

Inside the Main.java file there's a line that says:

  String stateToBeSolved = "wogybgryowgbowywbrogyrrb"

Change that input string to whatever your cube looks like by following this rule:
------------
Green is "g"
White is "w"
and so on...
------------
![Sample](sample_input.jpg)

So the input string from the image above would be:
"ywborworbyrwogywrbgogbgy"

After that Compile&Run and the solution should pop up in a few seconds!

Output for the cube state from the image above:
